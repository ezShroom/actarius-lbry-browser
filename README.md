# Actarius LBRY browser 
## An Electron-based browser that can view LBRY URLs
The LBRY network is dominated by apps developed by LBRY Inc (such as Odysee and the LBRY Desktop app) as the main way to access content. 
There are other, minor, solutions like the terminal-based FastLBRY project. We find this to be unintuitive, insufficient, and/or too centralized.
We want to develop a user-friendly, open-source LBRY network browser that communicates with the LBRY network with minimal dependency on any other entity.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer 
This project is in very early development. It will not function as a finished product.  
Actarius is not intended to become a fully functional browser and it shouldn't be used as a daily driver. However, basic browsing can be performed using it.

## Licensing
The project is based on open-source principles, and it is licensed under the OSSAL license. A similar, more permissive license is also used by the LBRY SDK, an optional tool for the browser.  
OSSAL restricts usage of the project in redistributions or usages that require modifications to be published with public source code, such as the GPL family of licenses.  
Versions of Actarius made before the 0.1 release use the MIT license, making them GPL-compatible.  
This brief explanation is not legal advice. Please read the [LICENSE](/LICENSE) file for more information.
